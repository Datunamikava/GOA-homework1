    A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client
    server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client,
     and any general-purpose programming language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server.
      A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (Front-end web development), server-side applications (back-end development),
       or both (full-stack development).
